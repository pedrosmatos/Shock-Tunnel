# Shock-Tunnel

This Jupyter calculates the conditions reached by user-specified driven gas in a typical shock tube/tunnel experimental test.

While the shock tube is always assumed to be in equilibrium, the nozzle exit parameters are calculated assuming three different conditions:
  - Frozen Flow,
  - Equilibrium and
  - Instantaneous transition from equilibrium to frozen at user-definied Mach number position.
