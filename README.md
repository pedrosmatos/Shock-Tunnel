### Shock Tube and Tunnel Calculator

This notebook assumes equilibrium flow to calculate shocked and reflected states of user-specified driven gas in a typical shock tube experiment

The nozzle exit parameters, otherwise, are calculated assuming three different conditions:
  - Frozen Flow,
  - Equilibrium and
  - Instantaneous transition from equilibrium to frozen at user-definied Mach number position.
