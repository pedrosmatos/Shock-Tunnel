### Shock Tube and Tunnel Calculator

This notebook assumes equilibrium flow to calculate shocked and reflected states of user-specified driven gas in a typical shock tube or tunnel experiment.

From given nozzle throat-to-exit area ratio, this jupyter also calculates exit parameters assuming three different conditions:
  - Frozen Flow,
  - Equilibrium Flow and
  - Instantaneous transition from equilibrium to frozen at user-definied Mach number position.
  
  Being based on Catera, this code can be easily modified to estimate, for example, ignition delay in shock tubes, or kinetic, thermodinamic and transport parameters.
