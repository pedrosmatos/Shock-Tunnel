    "For some initial shock tube configurations, the reflected shock wave interacts successively with the gas interface (that separates driver and driven gases) and the shock tube end wall. These reflections become continuously weaker until an equilibrium condition is reached in the test gas. These phenomena increase the reflected temperature, pressure and enthalpy and this mode of operation is also known as *over tailor condition*. As these additional shock waves diminish in intensity, [4 and 5] assume these compressions can be approximated by multiple isentropic processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accordingly to [6], the entropy change across a normal shock can be calculated for a calorically perfect gas as follows: \n",

This small increase in entropy in the latter case helps us to estimate the reflected or reservoir condition from measured pressures p$_{5E}$ by assuming and isentropic transformation from the calculated reflected state to experimental reflected state of measured pressure $p_{5E}$.    \n",

    "This block of code maps the shock tunnel for different input parameters following the procedures explained in the previous blocks. The `Input` function creates the `C5` array to condense shocked, reflected, and reservoir shock tube data and the three arrays Fr_Exit, Eq_Exit, and EF_Exit to be filled with standardized `Frozen_Area`, `Equilibrium_Area`, and `Eq_At_M_Area` nozzle exit outputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "To run the code, driver, driven, and nozzle data must be defined by the user in the interface control (based on ipywidgets library) at the end of the following code. The input data are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Driver Input tab:**\n",
    "   - Pressure *p4*: all the shock tunnel data are calculated for a fixed driver pressure value;\n",
    "   - Temperature *T4*: all the calculation considers a fixed value for driver temperature;\n",
    "   - Gas: when clicked, a dropdown list shows a list of some commom gases. For a different gas, one can select *Other*\\* in the dropped list and both gas *heat capacity ratio* and *mean molecular weight* (in unit of atomic mass) must be comma separated entered in *Other*\\* field. For example, insert *1.66, 32* for oxygen gas. This data will be used to calculate *Ms* by `Calc_Ms`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "**Driven Input tab:**\n",
    "   - Cantera Reaction: as default, the Gri3.0 gas mechanism is used to calculate the air parameters [1]. Other mechanisms can be found in [2];\n",

    "   - Pressure: the shock tube is calculated for different driven pressure values. In this field, a range of values must be inserted in the \"*initial pressure, final pressure, number of steps*\" form;  \n",

    "\n",
    "**Reservoir Input tab:**\n",
    "   - In the *'p5 Data'* radio button, two options are shown: *'Calculated p5'* and *'Measured p5e'*.\n",

    "     If the first option is chosen, the reservoir pressure is assumed to be the same as the calculated *p5*.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     If *'Measured p5e'* is chosen, the user must insert a list of experimental driven pressure in the *'p1 Data'* field and its respective measured reservoir pressure in the *'p5e Data'* field. This experimental data is fitted with a polynomial fit that will be used to estimate the reservoir pressure for any given *p1*; the poly fit degree must be inserted in the *'Poly fit Degree'* field.      \n",
    "   \n",
    "**Nozle Exit Input tab:** \n",
    "   - Area Ratio: the freestream parameter is calculated for a range of *p1* and nozzle exit area ratio *Ar*. In this field, a range of values must be inserted in the \"*initial area ratio, final area ratio, number of steps*\" form;  \n",
    "   - Equilibrium to Frozen at *M*: this is the Mach number that will me used in the `Eq_At_M_Area` to separate equilibrium from frozen flow; \n",
