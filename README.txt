This Jupyter calculates the conditions reached by user-specified driven gas in a typical shock tube/tunnel experimental test. While the shock tube is always assumed to be in equilibrium, the nozzle exit parameters are calculated assuming three different conditions: frozen, equilibrium and an instantaneous transition from equilibrium to frozen at user-definied Mach number position.
